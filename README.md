Setting: helping the South African government understand the transport distances involved with placing
a major grain storage facility at different nodes in the nation’s rail network. Because grain must be
carried by train, the analysis focused on minimum distances along the railroad network. The goal is to develop
an interactive tool that allows the policy makers to quickly analyze any potential site by simply specifying
its location. The tool’s specification is that a user must be able to tell the program a location and the
program should output a map depicting transport distances to all other nodes in the network.
